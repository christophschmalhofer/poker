  Definitions for computing a histogram of final hand orderings.

  A final hand ordering is defined by the relative rank of each player's hand
  after all cards are dealt.  For example, in a high-only game with 3 players,
  the possible final hand orderings for players A, B, and C are (where
  comma denotes tie):
        A B C
        A C B
        B A C
        B C A
        C A B
        C B A
        A B,C
        B A,C
        C A,B
        A,B C
        A,C B
        B,C A
        A,B,C
  Another way to reprsent this is to assign a player to a column and write
  the relative hand rank (1=best) in that column.  Then the possibilities
  above are written (in the same order as above) as
        A B C
        -----
        1 2 3
        1 3 2
        2 1 3
        2 3 1
        3 1 2
        3 2 1
        1 2 2
        2 1 2
        2 2 1
        1 1 2
        1 2 1
        2 1 1
        1 1 1
  Our encoding here is based on the second form.

  For high/low games, we track the full combination of outcomes.  In a
  2-person game with a qualifier for low, the possible outcomes are:
         HI         LO
        A  B       A  B
        1  1       1  1		tie for high; tie for low
        1  1       1  2		tie for high; A wins low
        1  1       1 NQ		tie for high; A wins low, B doesn't qualify low
        1  1       2  1		tie for high; B wins low
        1  1      NQ  1		etc.
        1  1      NQ NQ
        1  2       1  1
        1  2       1  2
        1  2       1 NQ
        1  2       2  1
        1  2      NQ  1
        1  2      NQ NQ
        2  1       1  1
        2  1       1  2
        2  1       1 NQ
        2  1       2  1
        2  1      NQ  1
        2  1      NQ NQ

  For ease of programming, we are somewhat wasteful of memory when storing the
  histogram of outcomes.  We allocate an array such that hist[i] is the number
  of times that outcome i occurs.  The integer i encodes the ordering of N
  players' hand ranks by using N bit fields, each bit field just large enough
  to represent the numbers [0..N].  The value 0 in bit field K indicates that
  player K has the strongest hand (possibly tying another player); the value
  N-1 indicates player K has the weakest hand; the value N indicates a
  non-qualifying hand (such as a 9-low in 8-or-better).  Note that not all
  integers i correspond to valid rank orderings, both due the fact that for
  some values of N the bit field can encode values greater than N, and due to
  the fact that some rank orderings, like a 3-way tie for 3rd place, are
  impossible.  That is the wasteful part; a hash table would solve it.

  For high-low games, we use two such sets of bit fields, packed adjacent to
  one another in a single integer.  The high-order bit fields correspond to
  the high hand; the low-order bit fields correspond to the low hand.
